# NAVER Vietnam AI Hackathon ‚Äì Preliminary Assignment
## "Student Time Management Solution"

---

**Important: Deadline is September 15th, 18:00!**

## üéØ Assignment Overview

**The Problem:** Vietnamese university students face a daily crisis of time management. Between classes, group projects, part-time work, and life, students juggle dozens of tasks across multiple platforms!

**Your Challenge:** Build a digital solution that helps Vietnamese university students better manage their time and navigate the chaos of student life.

**What We're Looking For:** We want to see how you approach problem-solving. A well-executed simple solution is better than an ambitious but broken one. That said, creativity and insight into real student needs will make you stand out.

## üìã Core Technical Requirements

Your solution must include:
1. **Full CRUD operations** on at least one data type
2. **Persistent storage** (local or remote)
3. **At least 3 different views** of the same data
4. **Time/date handling** in some capacity
5. **Support for 20+ items** without breaking

### Example: "Procrastination-Aware Smart To-Do List"
**Note: This is just ONE example to show how an app meets requirements. Build something different!**

A smart to-do list that learns from your procrastination patterns:

How it meets each requirement:
1. **CRUD Operations:** Create tasks with estimated time, read task list, update progress, delete completed tasks
2. **Persistent Storage:** Saves to localStorage with backup to a database, tracks completion patterns over time
3. **Three Views:** 
  - "Do Now" view (AI-sorted by urgency + your procrastination history)
  - Calendar view (see deadline collisions)
  - Analytics view (your productivity patterns, best work times)
4. **Time Handling:** 
  - Tracks estimated vs. actual completion time
  - Sends "start now or you'll be late" notifications based on your past behavior
  - Shows "realistic deadline" vs "official deadline"
5. **Handles 20+ items:** Lazy loading, virtual scrolling, search/filter for hundreds of tasks

Unique features this example might have - these are totally optional to implement, just some ideas for you. 
- **Procrastination coefficient:** Learns you take 3x longer than you estimate
- **Deadline pressure mode:** UI gets progressively more red as deadline approaches
- **"Shame mode":** Shows friends when you're behind (optional social pressure)
- **Auto-scheduling:** "You never work before 10pm, so I scheduled your tasks for 10pm"

**But you could also build:** A habit tracker, study session optimizer, group project coordinator, deadline collision detector, or anything else that meets these technical requirements.

**Build what makes sense to YOU, as long as it demonstrates real technical skills.**
